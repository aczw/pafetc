# PennApps Frontend Technical Challenge!

## Some details
Hi! I made my app using [React](https://reactjs.org/) as the library, with additional help from `npm` and `create-react-app` (found [here](https://create-react-app.dev/)) as a starting base. This was really fun to make, and I learned *a ton* about frontend programming, so thanks for the opportunity :)

Oh, I also took the liberty of using a different font throughout the app that I thought looked similar enough. It's called [Manrope](https://github.com/sharanda/manrope). I have a variable version of the font stored as a `.woff2` under `src/fonts`.

## Setup
I'm using GitHub Pages to host the most up to date version of my app, so simply visiting [this](https://aczw.github.io/pafetc/) link will take you to a live demo! Alternatively, my code is also publicly hosted under the [same](https://github.com/aczw/pafetc) repo name, so the code can also be downloaded and locally run. I did not touch any of the default `npm` scripts so `npm start` should launch a local instance at port 3000.

## Milestones
I reached milestone 2 after more than 3 hours of work, and with the limited time I had left, I wanted to spend on polishing the rest of the website instead of attempting something completely new, so I left it at that. The navigation bar works, but unfortunately it does not affix itself to the screen when scrolling down far enough. In addition, the clock is perpetually stuck at 13 :(

## Code overview
This was my first real opportunity to work with React, so I had to get used to the coding conventions pretty quickly. I separated the app into multiple components that I thought made sense together as a group, and then used the `Main.js` file to tie everything together. There are corresponding `.js` and `.css` files for each component, and I've tried to come up with names that are easily understood. This also enables modularity in my code, so adding new components should be a pretty similar (and easy) process!

I hope I was able to explain everything. Thanks again!
